# Qwik tutorial

ðŸ”„ Currently working on it

This was made for a university project. We need to present a innovative technology and my team decided to choose the Qwik meta-framework by Builder.io. We will have 1h30-2h to explain the base concept of Qwik, how it works and most importantly WHY it is innovative and WHY we have chosen Qwik for a demonstration

This repo will essentially host the template that other students will clone to discover Qwik. It will have basic configuration such as tailwind, tsconfig, basic eslint rules, packages to install and .vscode folder. See [my recommended guidelines](https://github.com/sqmasep/guidelines) for more information about best practices.
